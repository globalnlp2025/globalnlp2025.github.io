        <h2>Objectives of Workshop</h2>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) has advanced dramatically with the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI, greatly enhancing text generation, machine translation, and knowledge retrieval for high-resource languages such as English, Chinese, German, Spanish, and French. However, a large proportion of the world's languages—ranging from low-resource (e.g., Indigenous, African, Indian languages and minority languages) to under-resource (e.g., Irish language), medium-resource (e.g., Baltic, South Asian, and Slavic languages) continue to face significant challenges due to data scarcity, linguistic complexity, and limited computing resources. 
            We encourage both technical and non-technical papers containing experimental, theoretical, or methodological contributions. We explicitly seek interdisciplinary proposals that focus on participatory methods to develop NLP. This workshop intends to examine creative strategies that bridge the NLP gap across all language categories, utilizing cutting-edge techniques such as (but are not limited to):</p>
        <br>

        <li>Data-Efficient NLP: Uses transfer learning, few-shot learning, as well as zero-shot techniques to overcome data limitations.</li>
        <li>Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Models: Investigating approaches for training, fine-tuning, and adapting models to various linguistic structures, such as morphologically rich and agglutinative languages.</li>
        <li>Semantic-Based Approaches: Improving NLP applications with ontology-based information extraction, semantic similarity, entity linking, and connection extraction.</li>
        <li>Linked Data and Knowledge Graphs: Using structured knowledge for better machine translation, information retrieval, and automated reasoning for underrepresented languages.</li>
        <li>Practical Applications: Real-world implications for education, healthcare, climate, government strategy, as well as multilingual content creation using NLP.</li>
        <li>Tools for Corpus Creation and Linguistic Exploration: Creation of Corpus, Develop Models, Evaluation Metrics, Error Analysis.</li>
        <li>Reusability of linguistic resources in NLP applications (e.g., machine translation, POS tagging, syntactic parsing).</li>
        <br>
        <p>This workshop, which brings together academics, industry experts, and linguists, will promote collaboration and discussion about how to make NLP more inclusive and efficient across all languages.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        This workshop is designed for NLP researchers, linguists, industry experts, and AI practitioners working on language technologies, especially those in resource-constrained environments. The major goal is to bring together established and emerging scholars to discuss new ways to construct, optimize, and implement Large Language Models (LLMs) and other NLP techniques for low, mid, and underrepresented languages including academic researchers, industry executives, and students. Our contributors will come from universities, research institutes, technology businesses, and non-profit organizations that specialize in language technology development, linguistic resource generation, and computational modeling for languages.
